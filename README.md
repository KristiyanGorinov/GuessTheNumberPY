# GuessTheNumberPY
This is my second project for SoftUni "Guess The Number"

Here are the rules for the game:
*In the beggining you choose 1 from 3 options (this being the difficulty of the game)

*Every difficulty has its own settings
- Easy - If you number is further by 5 or more it will say /Too high/Too low/ otherwise it will say /Try a bit higher/Try a bit lower
- Medium - If you number is further by 10 or more it will say /Too high/Too low/ otherwise it will say /Try a bit higher/Try a bit lower
- Hard - If you number is further by 5 or more it will say /Too high/Too low/ otherwise it will say /Try a bit higher/Try a bit lower

Thats it for now.
